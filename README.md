# VariadicMinimumFinder

## Overview
The VariadicMinimumFinder is a versatile C++ program that showcases the power of variadic templates and function overloading to find the minimum value from a list of arguments. It also demonstrates the use of custom comparison functions to extend its functionality.

## Features
- **Variadic Templates**: Accepts any number of arguments.
- **Function Overloading**: Provides multiple versions of the `find_minimum` function.
- **Custom Comparison**: Allows the use of a user-defined comparison function.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler with support for C++11 or higher.

## Usage
Include the `find_minimum` and `find_minimum_custom` functions in your project. Call `find_minimum` with any number of comparable arguments to find the minimum value. Use `find_minimum_custom` to specify a custom comparison function.
